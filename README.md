# NumNom
Math game for small to medium sized Children. Made during the App A Week Challenge.

# Build Instructions

Due to the nature of this project your milage will vary when it comes to building the application. However, this should get you most of the way.

1. Install Qt from your repositories (if you are on a mondern Linux Distro) or download the software from  [https://www.qt.io/developers/](url)
2. If you want to build the Android version Download and install the Android SDK and NDK
3. Make sure you have the SDK enviroment setup to compile for version 4.0.1 of android (this is for maxium compatablity)
4. If you have Num-Nom installed on your phone you will need to uninstall it as you do not have the Key needed to sign the application, and the build will fail at install with out it if a signed version is 
available. 

Hits: Your systems Java implementation should work, but I have found that if it gives you trouble Androids SDK has a version that will work. 9/10 of your build issues will be because of Java so Check to make sure it is functioning properly before continuing.

# Install

If you install from source to your phone the IDE will do the install for you. If you want a signed version you can install it from the store.
